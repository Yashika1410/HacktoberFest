| ----------- | ----------- |
| heapSort.py      | 	Time complexity _O(nlog n)_ Space Complexity _O(1)_ Its underlying data structure, heap, can be efficiently used if we want to extract the smallest (or largest) from the list of items without the overhead of keeping the remaining items in the sorted order. For e.g Priority Queues.|
| ex: algname.py      | ex: it's use/ how it works/ it's complexity etc.,  |
